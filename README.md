# Odin Landing Page

## Description

This project is to create a landing page for a website. The goal is to utilize the flexbox skills I learned in the flexbox module. I will be taking some creative liberty to make the landing page standout. My goal is to create a landing page for a thifting resale company named Thrifting with C.
